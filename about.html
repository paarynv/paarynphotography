      <h2>My Story</h2>
      <p>
        For most of my life I have been a lover of animals and nature. Naturally, you take photos of things that are inspiring. So, I was animal-anthusiast first, photographer second. In 2022, when I got my first entry-level DSLR: the Canon EOS 2000D, that reversed. I fell in love with digital photography and, while I focus mostly on wildlife photography, I began to explore other domains. 
      </p>

      <p>
        In parallel with my photography journey, I caffeinated my way through a First Class degree in Physics, specialising in feedback control of electro-optic systems in the context of quantum gravity sensors and atomic clocks. This led to a graduate role working in the field of electro-optics, in the industry of aerospace. In my role, understanding how cameras work goes a long way! 
      </p>

      <p>
        And, crucially, I take pride in having 5+ years of experience tutoring 20+ students through A-level physis, having delivered 500+ hours of tutoring with several platforms and companies. Tutoring is how I have been able to serve society over the past half a decade. Through this work I have gained excellent insight into working with individuals 1-1 to help them reach their goals.

      <p>
        This leads me to now. I have a set of technical and people skills that allow me to serve your photography needs through a course (in development): from historical context, the underlying physics and, of course, practical 1-1 support on how you can become a better photographer.
